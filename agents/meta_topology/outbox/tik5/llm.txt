The error messages indicate that multiple agents are attempting to use the `openai.ChatCompletion` method, which is no longer supported in the version of the OpenAI library that is currently installed (1.0.0 or higher). 

To resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:

1. **Migrate to the New Interface**: You can run the command `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the new interface introduced in version 1.0.0. This is the recommended approach as it ensures you are using the latest features and improvements.

2. **Pin to an Older Version**: If you prefer to continue using the older interface, you can revert to an older version of the OpenAI library by running `pip install openai==0.28`. However, this is not recommended as it may limit your access to new features and improvements.

3. **Consult the Migration Guide**: A detailed migration guide is available in the OpenAI GitHub discussions [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742). Reviewing this guide can help you make the necessary changes to your code to comply with the new API.

Each agent should be updated to avoid using deprecated methods, ensuring they are compatible with the latest version of the OpenAI library.
