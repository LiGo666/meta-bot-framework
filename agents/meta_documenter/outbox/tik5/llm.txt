It appears that all agents are encountering the same error related to the deprecation of the `openai.ChatCompletion` method in the OpenAI Python client. This issue is likely due to an upgrade to version 1.0.0 or higher, which no longer supports the previous method of interaction.

### Recommended Solutions:
1. **Migrate Codebase**: Use the `openai migrate` command to automatically update your codebase to be compatible with the new interface.
   
2. **Pin to Old Version**: If immediate migration is not feasible, temporarily revert to the old version by running:
   ```
   pip install openai==0.28
   ```

3. **Check Migration Guide**: Refer to the detailed migration guide available at [OpenAI Migration Guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742) for further instructions on how to adapt your code to the new API.

### Next Steps:
- Implement one of the above solutions to resolve the errors across all agents.
- After making the necessary changes, run the agents again to ensure they function correctly without errors.
