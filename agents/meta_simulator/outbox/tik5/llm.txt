It seems that all agents are encountering the same issue related to the OpenAI Python API version. The error indicates that the `openai.ChatCompletion` method is not supported in the version of the API you are currently using (1.0.0 or higher). 

To resolve this issue, you have two primary options:

1. **Upgrade the Codebase**: You can run the command `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to the new interface introduced in version 1.0.0. This is the recommended approach if you want to use the latest features and updates provided by OpenAI.

2. **Pin to an Older Version**: If immediate migration is not feasible, you can temporarily pin your installation to an older version of the OpenAI Python API that still supports `openai.ChatCompletion`. You can do this by running:
   ```
   pip install openai==0.28
   ```
   This will allow your agents to function while you plan a migration to the new version.

Additionally, you can refer to the detailed migration guide available in the discussions section of the OpenAI GitHub repository to help you with the transition:
[OpenAI Python Migration Guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742).

Please proceed with one of these options to restore functionality to the agents.
