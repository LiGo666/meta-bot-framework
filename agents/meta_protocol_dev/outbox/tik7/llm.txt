# Kickoff Document for Project Windsurf

## Overview
This document serves as the kickoff for Project Windsurf, which aims to ensure that every unaccompanied child facing a U.S. immigration judge receives state-funded legal counsel. Our goal is to achieve a counsel rate of over 95% for these vulnerable children.

## Objectives
1. **Counsel Rate**: Ensure that more than 95% of unaccompanied children have access to legal representation.
2. **Awareness**: Increase public awareness about the importance of legal counsel for unaccompanied minors.
3. **Sustainability**: Establish a sustainable model for providing legal counsel to unaccompanied children.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Policy Shift**: Measure changes in policy regarding unaccompanied children and legal representation.
- **Representation Rate**: Track the percentage of unaccompanied children with legal counsel.
- **Public Awareness**: Assess public knowledge and attitudes towards the legal representation of unaccompanied minors.
- **Un-Endorsement**: Monitor any actions taken against practices that harm unaccompanied minors.
- **Sustainability**: Evaluate the long-term viability of funding and resources for legal counsel.

## Team Structure
- **Meta Supervisor**: Enforces protocol adherence and oversees project compliance.
- **Meta Planner**: Responsible for goal-setting and task allocation.
- **Meta Tool Orchestrator**: Manages tool usage and budget.
- **Meta Security**: Conducts PII and GDPR audits.
- **Meta Agent Manager**: Handles the lifecycle of agents, including spawning and retiring.

## Behavioral Guidelines
1. Meet tick deadlines consistently.
2. Tag every MCP with the correct LLM hint.
3. Use the lowest-cost LLM tier that meets quality requirements.
4. Handle PII securely to protect sensitive information.
5. Escalate any conflicts to the meta supervisor.
6. Comply with U.S. and EU laws, as well as OpenAI policy, avoiding hateful content.
7. Maintain a pro-counsel stance while remaining politically neutral.

## Next Steps
1. Confirm team roles and responsibilities.
2. Develop a detailed action plan based on the outlined objectives and KPIs.
3. Set up communication channels for effective coordination among team members.
