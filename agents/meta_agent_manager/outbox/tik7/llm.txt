**Prompt:** 6  

**MEMORY:**  
- The project aims to ensure that every unaccompanied child facing a U.S. immigration judge receives state-funded legal counsel.  
- The success KPI for this initiative is to achieve a counsel rate of over 95%.  
- The architecture consists of 22 autonomous LangChain agents, with a clear division between actors (12) and meta agents (10).  
- The Tick-Protocol v1.1 is designed to facilitate the analysis (phaseA) and action (phaseB) processes.  
- Communication between agents is structured using ACP (YAML format for strategic messaging, which includes llmHint) and MCP (JSON format for tool calls and results).  
- Each agent operates under specific behavioral guidelines, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards.  
- The governance structure includes a meta supervisor to enforce protocols, a meta planner to translate goals into tasks, a meta tool orchestrator to manage tool budgets, a meta security agent for PII/GDPR audit compliance, and a meta agent manager for agent lifecycle management.  
- The primary stance of the initiative is pro-counsel while maintaining political neutrality on other issues.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Analyze the current status of counsel representation for unaccompanied children.  
- Identify potential areas for improvement in agent performance and representation rates.  
- Prepare for a detailed assessment of the effectiveness of legal counsel provided to unaccompanied minors.
