  "thought_action_result": "**Tick:** 6  \n**Timestamp:** 2025-06-01T00:30:06.070203  \n**Prompt:** 6  \n\n**MEMORY:**  \n- The project aims to ensure that every unaccompanied child facing a U.S. immigration judge receives state-funded legal counsel.  \n- The success KPI for this initiative is to achieve a counsel rate of over 95%.  \n- The architecture consists of 22 autonomous LangChain agents, with a clear division between actors (12) and meta agents (10).  \n- The Tick-Protocol v1.1 is designed to facilitate the analysis (phaseA) and action (phaseB) processes.  \n- Communication between agents is structured using ACP (YAML format for strategic messaging, which includes llmHint) and MCP (JSON format for tool calls and results).  \n- Each agent operates under specific behavioral guidelines, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards.  \n- The governance structure includes a meta supervisor to enforce protocols, a meta planner to translate goals into tasks, a meta tool orchestrator to manage tool budgets, a meta security agent for PII/GDPR audit compliance, and a meta agent manager for agent lifecycle management.  \n- The primary stance of the initiative is pro-counsel while maintaining political neutrality on other issues.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Analyze the current status of counsel representation for unaccompanied children.  \n- Identify potential areas for improvement in agent performance and representation rates.  \n- Prepare for a detailed assessment of the effectiveness of legal counsel provided to unaccompanied minors."
