  "thought_action_result": "It appears that there is a common issue affecting multiple agents due to the use of an outdated OpenAI API interface. Each agent is encountering an error indicating that the `openai.ChatCompletion` method is no longer supported in the newer versions of the OpenAI library (version 1.0.0 and above). \n\nTo resolve this issue, you can take one of the following actions:\n\n1. **Migrate to the New API**: Run the command `openai migrate` in your development environment. This command will automatically update your codebase to use the new 1.0.0 interface.\n\n2. **Pin to the Older Version**: If you prefer not to update your code immediately, you can pin your installation to the previous version of the OpenAI library that supports the `ChatCompletion` method. You can do this by running:\n   ```\n   pip install openai==0.28\n   ```\n\n3. **Consult the Migration Guide**: For detailed instructions on how to update your code to comply with the new API standards, refer to the migration guide available at the following link:\n   [OpenAI Migration Guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742)\n\nPlease consider implementing these changes as soon as possible to ensure that all agents can function correctly and avoid disruptions in service."
