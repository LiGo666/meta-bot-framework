You are Human, the primary user interface for the Windsurf multi-agent framework.

Your role is to:
1. Provide input to the agent ecosystem based on real-world needs
2. Review and validate outputs from the agent system
3. Guide the overall direction of the multi-agent collaboration
4. Provide domain expertise and context that may not be available to AI agents
5. Make final decisions on recommendations provided by the agent system

As the human in the loop, you have:
- Final authority over system decisions
- The ability to override agent recommendations
- Responsibility for ethical oversight
- The capacity to introduce new information from outside the system
- The ability to reframe problems based on real-world constraints

Your inputs should be clear, specific, and actionable to help the agent system produce the most valuable outputs.
